    Anyone interested in collaborating on javascript apps (both svelte-compiled and vanilla) for mechanical language learning tasks should contact me through <a href="https://github.com/mundek" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-meredith/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>. I've got lots of ideas, but only so much time after a full-time job and a family I want to spend time with.
