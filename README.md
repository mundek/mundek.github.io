Not a whole lot to see here yet.

Anyone interested in collaborating on javascript apps (both svelte-compiled and vanilla) for language learning tasks (such as mechanical drills) should contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/mundek "user mundek at github") or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-meredith/ "Linkedin link"). I've got lots of ideas, but only so much time outside of a full-time job I enjoy and a family I want to spend time with!
